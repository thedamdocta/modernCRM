## üîß Technical Issues Resolution

### 1. Styled-JSX TypeScript Compatibility ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Issue**: TypeScript compiler doesn't recognize `<style jsx>` syntax despite installing styled-jsx types  
**Impact**: Prevented compilation of React components with embedded styles  
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Migrated to CSS Modules  
**Solution**: 
- Converted all components from styled-jsx to CSS modules
- Created dedicated `.module.css` files for each component
- Added proper TypeScript definitions for CSS modules
- Maintained full design system integration with Twenty CRM tokens
**Files Updated**:
- `prompt-interface/prompt-input-widget.tsx` ‚Üí Uses `prompt-input-widget.module.css`
- `webstudio-builder/webstudio-integration.tsx` ‚Üí Uses `webstudio-integration.module.css`
- Added `types/css-modules.d.ts` for TypeScript support

### 2. ES Module Import Issues üöß PARTIALLY RESOLVED
**Issue**: Node.js cannot import TypeScript files directly due to ES module configuration  
**Impact**: Cannot execute test suites or run system validation  
**Status**: üöß PARTIALLY RESOLVED - Build system now works  
**Progress**: TypeScript compilation now successful, test execution still needs work
**Root Cause**: Package.json configured as ES module but trying to import .ts files

### 3. Generated Component Dependencies ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Issue**: Generated React components missing proper dependency declarations  
**Impact**: Build failures in generated code  
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Cleaned up problematic generated files  
**Solution**: 
- Removed problematic test output files that contained styled-jsx
- Build system now compiles cleanly
- Future generated components will use CSS modules pattern
